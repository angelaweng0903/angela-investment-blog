<h3>Investment Thesis</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>Comprehensive platform + industry consolidation create a durable advantage.</strong>
    <p>
      Procore’s comprehensive suite of construction management software places it in a competitive position against other players. Given the company is targeting large enterprises with its pricing and offerings, the comprehensiveness of the software is a competitive advantage. As the construction industry is also consolidating, industry dynamics work strongly in Procore’s favor.
    </p>
    <ol type="a">
      <li>
        <strong>Tegus:</strong> Comprehensive software seems to be a big plus for companies, but pricing is a concern for not only SMBs but also mid-sized businesses.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Where it’s stickiest:</strong> Most sticky users are GCs; expansion to more owners and property management can be hard (and I also don’t think this is a huge focus for them).
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Procore is a system of record — a real platform (moat) — with real cross-selling opportunities.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>GTM strategy shift supports growth via new logos + cross-sell (even if upsell is harder).</strong>
    <p>
      Procore’s GTM strategy change aligns with their strategic initiatives and is expected to show results. A general-manager-based GTM strategy allows them to attract new customers as well as cross-sell better. This was seen in Atlassian (to be explored more) and has been successful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upselling is hard for Procore given their premium pricing; however, this new GTM strategy targets cross-selling and new customers, which allows for revenue growth opportunities. With some modest projections, I see revenue above consensus and in the high teens.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Margin expansion optionality.</strong>
    <p>
      Margin compression opportunities: Procore currently only sits in the low teens for Rule of 40. I see margin expansion opportunities with the new GTM strategy (not yet incorporated in the model because I need more research, and I don’t particularly need it right now since a DCF doesn’t work here).
    </p>

<h3>Growth</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Industry growth:</strong> In general, construction is structurally undersupplied.</li>
  <li><strong>Product/customer expansion:</strong> Procore is trying to penetrate specialty contractors.</li>
  <li><strong>International:</strong> ~15% international revenue today → expansion lever.</li>
  <li><strong>Customer base / stickiness:</strong> System of record platform dynamics support retention and expansion.</li>
  <li><strong>Cross-sell:</strong> Real cross-selling opportunities within the existing customer base.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Valuation & Exit Multiple Assumptions</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Comps:</strong> Selected comps based on vertical SaaS software.</li>
  <li><strong>Multiple:</strong> Used a <strong>9.5× 2025E forward EV/Revenue</strong> multiple, selected with considerations of the comps set and the multiple chart (see <em>Comps</em> figure below).</li>
  <li><strong>Context:</strong> This is higher than the <strong>~7.5× 2025E</strong> multiple implied by current EV.</li>
  <li><strong>Implied value:</strong> This gives a <strong>$82.31</strong> share price.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Other Thoughts / Concerns</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Early-stage posture:</strong> The business is still at an early stage where it should be growing fast while also showing strong momentum in cost discipline.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Pricing limits:</strong> Given pricing is already at a high end, growth through pricing (generally the most effective way to increase revenue) is not a very viable method.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Sensitivity:</strong> The stock will be highly sensitive to revenue growth rates and cost-cutting initiatives.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Margins vs peers:</strong> Compared to peers, gross margins are quite high (comparable to INTU), yet GAAP EBITDA margins are still negative — cost-cutting initiatives for opex are another focus in the long term.
  </li>
</ul>
