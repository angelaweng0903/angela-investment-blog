<h3>Investment Thesis Safran – Long Recommendation</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
    Safran sits in a very attractive position in the market, operating as an oligopoly within aircraft propulsion and competing primarily with Rolls-Royce and RTX (GE is excluded due to its joint venture with Safran). Propulsion is a highly lucrative segment given the size of the MRO aftermarket and the prevalence of long-term service contracts. With limited competition and a large base of recurring services revenue, Safran represents a premium-quality business. Aircraft Equipment & Defense is more competitive, but Safran has been active in M&A (e.g., the Collins acquisition) to deepen penetration and strengthen its positioning.

      <li>
        In the model, we observe cyclicality in year-over-year growth and therefore model accordingly, excluding COVID impacts under the assumption that the post-COVID boom has normalized. Original Equipment (OE) revenue is modeled to decelerate over time, while services revenue remains structurally strong. Overall revenue strength is modeled above consensus.
      </li>
      <li>
        The revenue build explicitly considers the launch timeline of the CFM LEAP-1A and LEAP-1B engines. LEAP-1B (expected to contribute beginning in 2026 following the Maverick blade introduction) is modeled to drive margin improvement, reflected through step-downs in COGS.

      <li>
        Recurring services revenue combined with limited competition results in strong pricing power within MRO.

    Safran’s valuation is driven predominantly by terminal value. Using a 12× exit multiple, the model implies over 50% upside to the current share price. Even under a downside scenario where cash flows are halved, the model still indicates approximately 35% upside. Under a perpetuity growth exit methodology, we continue to see over 20% upside. Combined with Safran’s strong competitive positioning, this presents an attractive long opportunity.

      <li>
        In terms of comps, GE and RTX both trade at higher valuation multiples. Despite being roughly twice the size of Safran by enterprise value, Safran’s growth trajectory and margin profile suggest meaningful upside relative to current trading levels.

<h3>Timing Considerations</h3>
<p>
  Safran currently trades at approximately <strong>17.4× EV/EBITDA</strong> based on the model, which sits toward the higher end of historical multiples when excluding COVID distortions. As such, near-term entry timing may not be optimal.
</p>
<p>
  That said, the DCF analysis still implies approximately <strong>52% upside</strong> using a 12× terminal multiple (the median across cycles), suggesting valuation support even at current trading levels.

<h3>Exit Multiple Assumptions</h3>

<p>
  A <strong>12×</strong> exit multiple is considered reasonable based on historical cycle medians and peer benchmarks.
