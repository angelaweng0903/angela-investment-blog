<h3>Thesis</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Aftermarket economics:</strong> A large installed base + recurring spares/MRO can create durable, high-margin cash flows.</li>
  <li><strong>Long-duration demand:</strong> Commercial aviation growth and fleet utilization drive steady service revenue over time.</li>
  <li><strong>Quality compounder:</strong> If execution holds, the market can continue to reward consistency + cash generation.</li>
</ul>

<h3>What I think the market is missing</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Where we are in the cycle vs normalized aftermarket profitability.</li>
  <li>How quickly mix shifts toward higher-margin services as the installed base grows.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Catalysts / What to watch</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Aftermarket growth and margin progression</li>
  <li>Production cadence / delivery trends across key airframe platforms</li>
  <li>Guidance updates and free cash flow conversion</li>
</ul>

<h3>Key risks</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Aviation downturn or OEM delivery disruptions</li>
  <li>Program-specific execution issues / cost inflation</li>
  <li>FX and macro sensitivity</li>
</ul>
